# Bank Transaction Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting bank transactions based on text data to better understand customer behavior and identify patterns using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Perform text preprocessing and feature extraction from bank transaction descriptions.
- Use classification models to segment transactions into predefined categories.
- Compare the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset includes transaction descriptions and associated labels for categories such as:
- **Groceries**
- **Utilities**
- **Entertainment**
- **Transport**
- **Other Expenses**


## Features
The analysis includes:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing transaction text.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating TF-IDF representations of transaction descriptions.
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comparing models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files:
- `bank_transaction_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis.
- `data/`: Directory for the dataset (if included).
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Requirements
To replicate the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
